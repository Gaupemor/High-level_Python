Report3 - Comparing numpy and python w/ numba

RESULTS
  Out of 10 runs

  Format:
    total time (time of inner calculation method - actual calculation of blur)

  blur_3:
    least: 2.782 (_calc(1.599)  -> method that is actually sped up with jit)
    greatest: 4.060 (_calc(1.728) -> method that is actually sped up with jit)

CALCULATION
  least:
    numpy is 6.022 times faster than numba
      (6.690 if only counting _calc())
    numba is 4.079 times faster than pure python
      (6.750 if only counting _calc())
  greatest:
      numpy is 7.561 times faster than numba
        (6.260 if only counting _calc())
      numba is 4.333 times faster than pure python
        (10.019 if only counting _calc())

PROS/CONS
  Using numba over numpy

  In this case, calculating with numpy arrays is faster than speeding up python calculations using numba.
  Using numba might also require you to rewrite parts of your code to make it C-interpretable.
  Numpy arrays also take up less memory space.
  However, in certain cases, numba might be able to optimize out temporaries an do loop unrolling,
  which numpy is not capable of.
