## How to run the scripts

## data.py
```
Run with python data.py
You will be presented with a text menu
Choose the features you want to visualize
If run as a script, it returns a plot
```

## fitting.py
```
Run with python fitting.py
Follow the text menu like mentioned
If ran as a script, returns the prediction scores
```
## visualize.py
```
Run with visualize.py
Follow the text menu

Note: The plotting does not work. I was not able to make it work without making
      substantial changes to the code, so I refrained from doing so.
```

##web_visualisation.py
```
Run with python web_visualisation.py
Visit localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:5000
Follow the interactive menus

Note: Does not display the plot, because visualize.py does not work.
```
